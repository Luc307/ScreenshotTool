This tool, which runs minimally in the background, automatically renames screenshots for the first time. This will be the MVP. The tool will then be expanded to include automatic folder sorting. Other types of photos (not just screenshots), videos, and the download folder are further areas that the tool could target. The image is analyzed using AI.



The first Version will not run in the background. It will be an WPF Window where you can upload a picture and an AI will analyse that picture and give one key word.



When the product is finished I will create a website for it and make it downloadable.
